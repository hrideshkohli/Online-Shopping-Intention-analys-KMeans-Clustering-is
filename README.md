# Online-Shopping-Intention-analysis-KMeans-Clustering

[!]

This project is about analysing online shopping intention from the customer specific website statistics. The idea is to create a new strategy or change existing strategy to ensure more customers buy products when they visit the website 

The growing popularity of **online shopping** has led to the emergence of new economic activities. To be successful in a highly competitive eCommerce environment, it is essential to understand **customers’ online purchase intent**.

## Introduction to Online Shopping Intention Analysis
In recent years, e-commerce has brought huge benefits to suppliers and consumers. Defined as the use of the Internet to sell products or services to individual consumers, e-commerce has profoundly changed the way people conduct their business

Indeed, it has become an important full-fledged transaction channel. A recent survey of online shopping predicted that the total amount of direct sales to customers will exceed $ 240 billion by 2007. Major technological innovations in online shopping have changed transaction channels in the information age.

With the growth of online shopping, it has become important to understand the factors that influence a consumer’s intention to buy from a website rather than just browse. This emerging topic is of interest to both academics and machine learning practitioners

### Algorithm, Concept and EDA:

Since this is an **Unsupervised** problem, I used K-means clustering algorithm to distinguish between intersted customers and uninterested customers and then analyzed their behaviour w.r.t revenue i.e how many interested customers actually contributed in revenue and so on.

As per the descriptions of the features, certain important features were selected and then **ELBOW METHOD** was used to select appropriate number of clusters after which model was trained.

## Conclusion
Customers who spent more time on a product-related website are very less likely to leave the website after viewing a single page
